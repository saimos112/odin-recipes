    <h2>What is so good about this recipe?</h2>
    <p>
      This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb
      topping is creamy and comforting. It's easy to make the cheese sauce from
      scratch on your stovetop, starting with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar,
      and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook
      and cranny of the noodles. Serve this comfort-food macaroni and cheese
      casserole with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried chicken or alongside a
      salad for a meatless dinner.

      <li>¼ cup salted butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>

    <h3>Bread Crumb Topping:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
      <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps you will need take for this delicious meal:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch
        square baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet
        over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes
        paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a
        simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses;
        season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is
        melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup
        more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet
        over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and
        browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle
        with paprika.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni
        and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
