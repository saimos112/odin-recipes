    <h3>Steps you will need take for this delicious meal:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly spray a
        muffin tin with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dust a work surface with flour and roll out pie dough to a thickness of
        about 1/8 inch. Cut out 12 circles using a 4-inch round pastry cutter,
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer dough into lightly sprayed muffin tin. Press the dough gently
        into the bottom and sides. Refrigerate while you prepare the filling
      </li>
      <li>
        Add apple juice into a saucepan and simmer over medium-high heat until
        it has reduced to 3 or 4 tablespoons of apple syrup. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place brown sugar into a bowl and pour apple syrup on top of the sugar.
        Add melted butter, egg, cream, vanilla, and salt. Whisk until filling is
        liquid and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pull pastry out of the fridge. Divide walnuts evenly on top of the
        bottom of the tart shells. Pour filling on top about 2/3 full. Tap the
        pan to smooth out filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until crust is cooked through and the filling
        is bubbly, about 20 minutes. Let cool for about 10 minutes then remove
        from the muffin tins and serve at room temperature.
