    <h2>What is so good about this recipe?</h2>
    <p>
      Nobody makes casserole like your Grandma. That's why this old-fashioned
      ground beef casserole with egg noodles is always such a hit! It's made
      with ingredients you already have on hand (and, of course, a little bit of
      love).
    </p>
    <h3>What ingredients you will need:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>3 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 large white onion, diced</li>
      <li>Â½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps you will need take for this delicious meal:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in
        the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and
        discard grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix tomato sauce, sugar, garlic salt, and salt into the ground beef;
        simmer until flavors blend, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat,
        cover the skillet, and cool to room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to
        a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
        until cooked through but firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the egg noodles are cooking, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown, 25
        to 30 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Can you freeze Ground Beef Casserole?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, you can freeze ground beef casserole. If you plan to freeze it, it's
      best to make the casserole in an aluminum casserole pan so you can bake
      and freeze it in the same dish. Allow the casserole to cool, then cover
      tightly. Wrap the entire dish (pan and cover included) in one layer of
      storage wrap followed by one layer of foil.
